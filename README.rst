    ... Sometimes I feel like there should be a canonical reference for novice programmers with links to all this stuff.

    E.g. Want to know what Netiquette is? Read this RFC. Curious about HTTP? Here's the RFC and some other good materials.

    I think there are many "perma threads" that all beginners eventually end up asking, it would cool (sic) if they were all easily accessible from one place.


More to come. Just watch.
